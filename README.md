# multi-step-form

# What have I learned
- Mixins are better with parameters and default values
- BEM simplifies writing sass
- Use data-* attribute insted of class in js selectors
- Return after if statement simplifies code
- Use functions for gathering code
- There are default, predefined methods in js for most problems
- Optimisation process:
  - optimise only working code
  - rewrite names
  - delete redundation (use functions)
  - use reverse thinking (for if statements)
